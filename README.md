This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) start using typescript, sass and recoil 



## 🏁  Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 📝 CLI templates

You can generate templates files for *components* and *pages* with this command: 

```bash
yarn template
```
After that, type :
 - ``page`` if you need a new page
 - ``component`` if you need a new component
 
Then type the name of the file  you want to create


## 💅 Styles
This projet is using a sass compiler and css modules. 

### Theme
Your themes files are stored in the *styles/theme* folder and should be imported in the *theme.scss* file.

Each components/page style that need some theme data will need to import the theme like so: 
```sass
@import "@styles/theme.scss";
```

### Stylesheets
Styles classes are using css modules and are scoped within the component or page they're used.
